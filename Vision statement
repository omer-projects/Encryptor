•	Black and white encryption of one single image inside another image.
•	Provides a JPEG result image.


High-level features: 

•	Easy and convenient GUI to select an image to encrypt, a "cover image" and encryption parameters.
•	Upload an image from gallery
•	Take a photo directly from the camera to the application.
Note: will be implemented in the next version.
•	Export the encrypted image as a JPEG image.


Major milestones and deliverables:

•	Mobile application which provides interface for selecting images and parameters.
•	Runs the encryption algorithm for the required images and parameters and shows the result image.
•	Export the encrypted image to a local directory as a JPEG file.
